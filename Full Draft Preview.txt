In this full draft you will see a brain on a table with the typical symptoms of a concussion written over the brain. 
The light above the brain is used to highlight the already very known symptoms. In the background, there are other symptoms 
which are equally as important, but ones that many individuals forget about or don't know when someone gets a concussions. 
I attempted to point out these symptoms with the statement that I stated above the brain. One thing that I hope to add, is 
an image of someone leaning over the table, kind of like they have a headache. However, I am still figuring out how I'd like 
to incorporate that. Along with this, I'm leaning more towards changing the font in the brain, as well as, above the brain in 
the rhetorical statement. I feel as though the font in the brain, being the same as the font of the symptoms outside of the 
light does not differentiate them as much as I would like. Aside from this, I feel as though the project is coming together 
depsite there being a few missing pieces.
