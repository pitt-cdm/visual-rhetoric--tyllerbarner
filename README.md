Concussions. Something that has been somewhat of a mystery to many. There are typical symptoms and signs that one is told 
to look out for if they hit their head. If you have light sensitivity, nausea, vommiting, headaches, and many others then 
it's advised that you visit a physician get checked for concussions. However, no one really discusses the lasting emotional 
and mental affects that concussions can have on an individual. 

This project aims to display the symptoms that many people may not think about when discussing concussions. How these emotional
and mental symptoms remain in the background of the more prominent systems, which makes them of equal danger with their long-
lasting effects.
