What I’ve included in my preview is a brain being put on display with typical symptoms of a concussion within the brain. 
My future plan is to 1.) use a better font and 2.) insert symptoms or lasting effects that often times go unnoticed 
in the darker shadows of the image. I am having trouble of how to incorporate new fonts that I download and 
also how I should layout my words throughout the image. I’m also unsure if I should include another image 
or how I could better expand on my message without the image becoming too cluttered but also so that the image 
isn’t very basic.
